Study Focus Tab Blocker
A Chrome extension to help you stay focused by blocking new tabs until a set study time ends. Created to support my dorm mate who struggles with self-control while studying!

Description
This extension locks new tab openings in Chrome until a predefined study timer expires. It’s perfect for students who get distracted by opening new tabs (like typing websites) during study sessions. Once the timer is set, new tabs are blocked, encouraging uninterrupted focus.

Features
Set a custom study duration (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour).
Blocks new tabs until the timer ends.
Simple interface to start and stop the study mode.
Notification when the study period is over.

Installation
Clone or download this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/tab-guard.git

Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing this repository.
The extension should now appear in your Chrome toolbar.

Usage
Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the popup.
Enter the desired study time (in minutes) and click "Start Study Mode".
While in study mode, attempting to open a new tab will be blocked with a message.
When the timer ends, you’ll receive a notification, and new tabs will be allowed again.
Click "Stop Study Mode" to end the session early if needed.

How It Was Born
I built this for my dorm mate who said, "Hey bro, I can’t control myself after I try to study—I end up on typing websites!" Tired of seeing him distracted, I created this tool to enforce focus during study time.
